### How You Can Contribute 🤝
We’re thrilled to have you as part of our core team! To contribute effectively, it’s important to follow some guidelines. First, always adhere to established conventions and maintain consistency across all codebases. The detailed contribution guide, which is available in `COLLABORATION.md`, outlines the best practices and workflows for this project.

The repository is divided into four main areas. The _Admin Dash_ and _User Dash_ are built using frameworks such as Vue.js, Vue-TS, Next.js, and Next-TS. If you enjoy working on intuitive interfaces, these sections are for you. The _API App_, developed with NestJS, serves as the backbone of the project, making it ideal for those with a passion for backend development. Finally, the _API Docs_ use OpenAPI to ensure the API is well-documented and accessible, perfect for contributors who excel in creating clear documentation.

Communication and collaboration are key. Use GitHub issues and pull requests to share updates, report bugs, and suggest improvements. Constructive feedback is always appreciated. Additionally, it’s crucial to maintain a positive and inclusive environment, respecting the contributions of all team members. Together, we can build something exceptional.
